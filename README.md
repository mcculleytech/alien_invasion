In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can moce the ship left and right using the arrow keys and shooting with the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of alien ships fills the sky and moves accross and down the screen. If the fleet gets cleared, another faster one takes it's place. If any of the fleet reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. Lose three ships and the game is over.
